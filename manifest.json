  "description": "You play as Mochi, a black cat who has been imprisoned in a hostile world. You need to escape a series of areas under the cover of darkness to regain your freedom. Electricity is not your friend, control it using red levers. Water and sharp spikes are also to be avoided where possible. You only have 9 halves of heart for lives, when these are gone you need to restart the level. Your only defence against guardian drones is to lure them to electric fields or water. Springs can help you access hard-to-reach places. Collect keys to unlock doors - press Down whilst on a locked door, then press Down on an unlocked door to use it. Once you have collected all the coins, look for the chequered finish point on each level to progress to the next",
